🚀 JSohNO – The Ultimate AI-Optimized Encoding System

"AI-safe, token-efficient, lossless string transmission... without all the legacy baggage."







---

💡 What is JSohNO?

JSohNO is an ultralightweight, AI-optimized text encoding format that revolutionizes how large, unstructured text is processed for machine learning models.

Inspired by DNA recombinant encoding, it:

✅ Reduces token usage by up to 87%

✅ Guarantees 100% API safety

✅ Achieves near-lossless content retention (even up to 3.14M charToks)

🔥 Why JSohNO?

🚀 Speed: Processes and recombines text with near-zero latency.

🛡 Safety: Guarantees API-safe text transmission without complex escaping.

🎯 Efficiency: Reduces AI API costs by up to 70%.

🤖 AI-First: Optimized for LLMs with next-gen tokenization logic.

🔄 Self-Contained: No dependencies. The encoded header includes all required mappings.

⚡️ How It Works

1. Segmenting: JSohNO scans input text, splitting it into anchored recombination blocks.


2. Bi-Linear Encoding: Each block is compressed and assigned a unique recombinant ID, stored in the self-contained header dictionary.


3. Reassembly: Decoding reconstructs text exactly, using our patented fast-recombinant traversal™.

🏗 Example

Before (Raw HTML)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

After (JSohNO Encoded)

JSohNOv1|A1:<html>|A2:</html>|B1:<head>|B2:</head>|...
A1 B1 D1Page TitleD2 B2 C1 E1G1E2 F1H1F2 C2 A2

Decoding

const originalText = JSohNO.decode(encodedText);
console.log(originalText);
